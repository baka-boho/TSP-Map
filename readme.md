# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
This repository contains the code for a web application that visualizes and helps solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

What is the TSP?

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem. It asks the following question:

Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city?

This problem can be visualized as a salesman who needs to visit all the cities in their territory while minimizing travel time.

Features of this App:

Map Visualization: The app displays a map of ALGERIA with 14 markers representing the cities.
Find Optimal Route: The app provides the challenge of trying to find the shortest possible route in an interactive way.

Future Improvements:

- Implement different TSP solving algorithms for comparison.
- Allow users to upload their own city data (e.g., CSV file).
- Enhance the user interface for better interaction.
